## Function Composition

- **Composition** occurs when a function call is used as an argument to another function call, which may, in turn, be passed to another function call.
- The return value of the inner function call is used as the argument to the outer function.

```python
print(list(range(3, 17, 4)))
```

**Note**: Ask Simone about what she understands about this sentence: "Composition works best when each function except the outermost returns a usable value." What is an unusable value?
