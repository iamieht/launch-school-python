# Data Types (Q&A)

1. Name all primitive data types, including category and class?

2. Name all non-primitive data types, including category and class?

3. Which data types are mutable and which ones not?

4. What kind of data types are functions and NoneType?

5. What is the definition of literals?

6. Which Python objects have no literal form, so we need to use the type constructor to create them?

7. Are these valid integer values?

```python
int1 = 123.456.678
int2 = 123,456,678
int3 = 123_456_678
int4 = 123456678
```
8. Are these valid floats values?

```python
float1 = 1.0
float2 = 42,348.35
float3 = 42.348,35
float4 = 42_348.35
float5 = 42348.35
```
