# Variables

- Are labels that identify particular objects in a program
- Are labels attached to a specific value stored in a program's memory

## Variables and Variable Names

```python
answer = 41
print(answer)       # 41

answer = 42
print(answer)       # 42
```

In line 1, Python sets aside a bit of memory and stores the value `41` in that area. It also creates a variable named `answer`.

On line 3, we **reassign** the value `42` to the variable `answer`. Python makes `answer`refer to a new object. We are not changing the object that represents `41`, we are assigning a complete new value to the `answer` variable.

### Variable Naming

- A variable name must accurately and concisely describe the variable's data.
- **Identifiers** is a term used to refer to the following things:
	- Variable and constant names
	- Function and method names
	- Function and method parameter names
	- Class and module names

## Naming Conventions

- Names that follow Python naming conventions are **idiomatic**
- Those names that do not follow the naming conversions are **non-idiomatic** (still valid) or illegal (will raise syntax error)

### Naming conventions for most identifiers (excluding constants and class names):

- Use **snake_case** formatting.
- Names may contain lowercase letters, digits and underscores.
- Names should begin with a letter.
- Separate the words with a single underscore.
- Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning under the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
- Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set
- Examples:

|Idiomatic Names|
|---|
|`foo`|
|`answer_to_ultimate_question`|
|`eighty_seven`|
|`index_2`|
|`index2`|

### Constant names (unchanging named values):

- Use **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** formatting.
- Names may contain lowercase letters, digits and underscores.
- Names should begin with a letter.
- Separate the words with a single underscore.
- Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning under the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
- Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set.
- The constant naming convention is advisory only. Python has no way to ensure that constants are never changed. Whether a constant ever changes is entirely up to the programmer, not Python.
- Examples:

|Idiomatic Names|
|---|
|`FOO`|
|`ANSWER_TO_ULTIMATE_QUESTION`|
|`EIGHTY_SEVEN`|
|`INDEX_2`|
|`INDEX2`|

### Class names:

- Use **PascalCase** also called **CamelCase** formatting.
- Names may contain uppercase and lowercase letters and digits.
- Names should begin with an uppercase letter.
- If the names has multiple words, capitalize each word.
- Examples:

|Idiomatic Names|
|---|
|`Foo`|
|`UltimateQuestion`|
|`FourLeggedPets`|
|`PythonVersion2Rules`|

### Non-idiomatic

- You can use letters, digits, and underscores in Python identifiers. Extended ASCII and Unicode letters and digits are allowed.
- You may not use punctuation characters, most special characters, or whitespace.
- You may not start identifiers with a digit.
- You may not use Python's reserved words such as `if`, `def`, `while`, `return`, and `pass` as names.
- Examples:

|Non-Idiomatic Names|Explanation|
|---|---|
|fourWayIntersection|camelCase|
|Sch√∂n|Extended ASCII|

|Illegal Names|Explanation|
|---|---|
|pass|Reserved word|
|3xy|Starts with digit|
|ultimate-question|Hyphen|
|one two three|Whitespace|
|is_lowercase?|Punctuation|
|is+lowercase|Special character|

## Creating and Reassigning Variables

- We create (initialize) a variable by simply giving it a value. That happens as part of an assignment statement:

```python
forename = 'Clare'            # initialization
```

- We can also give new values to variables by simply reassigning them:

```python
forename = 'Victor'           # reassignment
```

- Way to describe an assignment: The variable `foo`is assigned the value of `bar`.

### How Initialization and Reassignment Work

- When you initialize a variable, Python creates its initial value and sticks it somewhere in the computer's memory. It also allocates a small amount of memory for the variable itself, then places the value's memory address into the variable's spot in memory.
- Example:

```python
foo = 'abcdefghi'
```

Python creates the string `abcdefghi` somewhere in the memory. Next it will create a variable somewhere else in memory. Then associates the variable name with the address in memory. Then Python stores the address of the string at the address of the variable name.

Later we reassign the variable `foo`to another value:

```python
foo = 'Hello'
```

Python creates the new string `Hello` somewhere in memory. Since we already have a `foo`variable, Python replaces the value at variable's address with the new address of the value `Hello`. This breaks the connection with the original string and establishes a new one with the new string.

## Creating Constants

- Constants are created (initialized) in the same way as variables: by giving them a value:

```python
PINING_FOR = 'fjords'         # initialization
```

- Python does not support true constants. Instead, the **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** naming convention is solely for programmers.

## Expressions and Assignment

- Assignment and reassignment often use expressions on the right side `=`to determine the desired value.
- Example:

```python
def square(number):
    return number * number

forty_two_squared = square(42)
print(forty_two_squared)                # 1764
```

- The expression on the right side of the `=` operator can be any valid expression.
- The variable to the left of the `=` operator is always the target variable for the resulting value. That is, the expression's value will be assigned to the variable.
- It's worth noting that the right side of an assignment is always completely evaluated before assigning the result to the variable.

```python
foo = 42            # foo is 42
foo = foo - 2       # foo is now 40
foo = foo * 3       # foo is now 120
foo = foo + 5       # foo is now 125
foo = foo // 25     # foo is now 5
foo = foo / 2       # foo is now 2.5
foo = foo ** 3      # foo is now 15.625
print(foo)          # prints 15.625
```

- In lines 2-7, the right side of each assignment is computed first using whatever value `foo` had most recently. Thus, `foo` was 42 on line 2, 40 on line 3, and so on. On each line, a computation is performed using the current value of `foo`. Python then reassigns the newly computed value to `foo`.

## Augmented Assignment

- It's a shorthand notation also called **assignment operators**, of the process of taking the current value of a variable, perform an arithmetic operation on the variable's value, and then reassign the variable to the newly computed value.

```python
foo = 42            # foo is 42
foo -= 2            # foo is now 40
foo *= 3            # foo is now 120
foo += 5            # foo is now 125
foo //= 25          # foo is now 5
foo /= 2            # foo is now 2.5
foo **= 3           # foo is now 15.625
print(foo)          # prints 15.625

bar = 'xyz'          # bar is 'xyz'
bar += 'abc'         # bar is now 'xyzabc'
bar *= 2             # bar is now 'xyzabcxyzabc'
print(bar)           # prints xyzabcxyzabc

bar = [1, 2, 3]     # bar is [1, 2, 3]
bar += [4, 5]       # + with lists appends
                    # bar is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(bar)          # prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

bar = {1, 2, 3}     # bar is {1, 2, 3}
bar |= {2, 3, 4, 5} # | performs set union
                    # bar is now {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
bar -= {2, 4}       # - performs set difference
                    # bar is now {1, 3, 5}
print(bar)          # prints {1, 3, 5}
```

## Reassignment vs. Mutation

- There are two ways to change things in Python:
	- Change the **binding** of the variable by making it reference a new object (**Reassignment**).
	- Change the value of the object assigned (**bound**) to the variable (**Mutation**).
- **Reassignment** makes the variable name refer to a different object somewhere else in memory.
- **Mutation** does not change which object the variable refers to, instead it changes the object itself. After mutating an object assigned to a specific variable, the variable continues to refer to the same object (albeit altered) at the same memory location.
- **Reassigning** an element of a mutable collection doesn't reassign the variable; it mutates the collection.
- Examples:

```python
num = 3               # assignment (initialization)
my_list = [1, 2, 3]   # assignment (initialization)
my_dict = {           # assignment (initialization)
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2
}

num = 42              # Reassignment
my_list[1] = 42       # Reassignment of element,
                      # my_list is mutated!
my_dict['b'] = 3      # Reassignment of dict pair
                      # my_dict is mutated!

# You can still reassign the variables
my_list = (2, 3, 4)   # Reassignment
my_dict = { 'x': 0 }  # Reassignment
```
