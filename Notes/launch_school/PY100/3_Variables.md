# Variables

- Are labels that identify particular objects in a program
- Are labels attached to a specific value stored in a program's memory

## Variables and Variable Names

```python
answer = 41
print(answer)       # 41

answer = 42
print(answer)       # 42
```

In line 1, Python sets aside a bit of memory and stores the value `41` in that area. It also creates a variable named `answer`.

On line 3, we **reassign** the value `42` to the variable `answer`. Python makes `answer`refer to a new object. We are not changing the object that represents `41`, we are assigning a complete new value to the `answer` variable.

### Variable Naming

- A variable name must accurately and concisely describe the variable's data.
- **Identifiers** is a term used to refer to the following things:
	- Variable and constant names
	- Function and method names
	- Function and method parameter names
	- Class and module names
