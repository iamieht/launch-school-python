# Variables

- Are labels that identify particular objects in a program
- Are labels attached to a specific value stored in a program's memory

## Variables and Variable Names

```python
answer = 41
print(answer)       # 41

answer = 42
print(answer)       # 42
```

In line 1, Python sets aside a bit of memory and stores the value `41` in that area. It also creates a variable named `answer`.

On line 3, we **reassign** the value `42` to the variable `answer`. Python makes `answer`refer to a new object. We are not changing the object that represents `41`, we are assigning a complete new value to the `answer` variable.

### Variable Naming

- A variable name must accurately and concisely describe the variable's data.
- **Identifiers** is a term used to refer to the following things:
	- Variable and constant names
	- Function and method names
	- Function and method parameter names
	- Class and module names

## Naming Conventions

- Names that follow Python naming conventions are **idiomatic**
- Those names that do not follow the naming conversions are **non-idiomatic** (still valid) or illegal (will raise syntax error)

### Naming conventions for most identifiers (excluding constants and class names):

- Use **snake_case** formatting.
- Names may contain lowercase letters, digits and underscores.
- Names should begin with a letter.
- Separate the words with a single underscore.
- Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning under the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
- Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set
- Examples:

|Idiomatic Names|
|---|
|`foo`|
|`answer_to_ultimate_question`|
|`eighty_seven`|
|`index_2`|
|`index2`|

### Constant names (unchanging named values):

- Use **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** formatting.
- Names may contain lowercase letters, digits and underscores.
- Names should begin with a letter.
- Separate the words with a single underscore.
- Names that begin or end with one or two underscores have special meaning under the naming conventions. Don't use them until you understand how they are used.
- Names may only use letters and digits from the standard ASCII character set.
- The constant naming convention is advisory only. Python has no way to ensure that constants are never changed. Whether a constant ever changes is entirely up to the programmer, not Python.
- Examples:

|Idiomatic Names|
|---|
|`FOO`|
|`ANSWER_TO_ULTIMATE_QUESTION`|
|`EIGHTY_SEVEN`|
|`INDEX_2`|
|`INDEX2`|

### Class names:

- Use **PascalCase** also called **CamelCase** formatting.
- Names may contain uppercase and lowercase letters and digits.
- Names should begin with an uppercase letter.
- If the names has multiple words, capitalize each word.
- Examples:

|Idiomatic Names|
|---|
|`Foo`|
|`UltimateQuestion`|
|`FourLeggedPets`|
|`PythonVersion2Rules`|

### Non-idiomatic

- You can use letters, digits, and underscores in Python identifiers. Extended ASCII and Unicode letters and digits are allowed.
- You may not use punctuation characters, most special characters, or whitespace.
- You may not start identifiers with a digit.
- You may not use Python's reserved words such as `if`, `def`, `while`, `return`, and `pass` as names.
- Examples:

|Non-Idiomatic Names|Explanation|
|---|---|
|fourWayIntersection|camelCase|
|Sch√∂n|Extended ASCII|

|Illegal Names|Explanation|
|---|---|
|pass|Reserved word|
|3xy|Starts with digit|
|ultimate-question|Hyphen|
|one two three|Whitespace|
|is_lowercase?|Punctuation|
|is+lowercase|Special character|
