# Flow Control

- **Flow Control** is the path that you want your data to take when writing programs.

## Conditionals

- Fork(s) in the road. Python evaluates the conditional and tells the data where to go.
- **Block** is one or more Python statements.
- `else` block isn't a proper statement; it's part of the `if` statement.
- You have as many `elif` blocks as you need. They are evaluated in the order they appear in the code.
- All statements in a block must be indented from the statement that begins the block. The indentation in a block must be consistent.

```python
if value == 3:
    print('value is 3')
elif value == 4:
    print('value is 4')
else:
    print('value is NOT 3 or 4')
```
