# Loops and Iterating

- Loops runs while a given condition remains truthy or until it becomes falsy.
- Python loops mechanisms: for, while, comprehensions, generators and functional loops.

## while Loops

- Syntax: `while` `<conditional expression>:` `block of code`
- We must arrange to terminate the loop, otherwise the loop is an **infinite loop** 
- Each block run is called an **iteration**

```python
counter = 1
while counter <= 10:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```
