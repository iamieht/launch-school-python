# Determine the length of the string "These aren't the droids you're looking for.".
string = "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
print(len(string))

# We can determine the length of a string using the built-in len function. An empty string will have a length of 0.

# The len function also works with all built-in collections, such as lists, sets, ranges, and dictionaries.
