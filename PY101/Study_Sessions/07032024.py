# Create a range from 1 to 10 of only odd numbers
# Create a list of elements from the string = "Hello, World!"
# Create a new list with the string = "Hello, World!" reversed
# Modify from the 2nd to the 5th element (inclusive) of the following sequence seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] to 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'

# Ex3
